Hello!!
The proyect you'll see is an easy and understandable code about 
controling any servo motor with your arduino and digital stop points.
Also with led feedback!!! An important aspect when human-machine 
manipulation is necessary.

You can add more stop-points and edit the code as you want!!!
And publish the same code without any concernation because
I believe in the open-code :)
